+Code the following app
+```
+Create a groundbreaking AI-powered mini app for Base called “Proof-of-Vibe” – the first on-chain mood & reputation layer.
+
+Core idea:  
+Users connect their wallet once and grant the app permission to anonymously read their on-chain history (trades, NFT holds, DeFi positions, social posts on Farcaster, Lens follows, etc.). The AI instantly generates a beautiful, shareable “Vibe Card” – a dynamic NFT that visually represents their unique crypto personality, risk profile, aesthetics, and community alignment in real-time.
+
+Unique features that make it stand out:
+1. Daily regenerating Vibe Card (free mint or small fee) with rare traits based on actual behavior (e.g., “Diamond Hands Since 2021”, “Degenerate Gambler”, “Based Art Collector”, “Farcaster Poet”, “Yield Chad”, etc.)
+2. Vibe Score (0–1000) that updates live and can be used by other dApps (with user permission) for social matching, exclusive access, airdrops, or dating-style “vibe checks”
+3. “Vibe Match” – swipe-like interface to find other users with compatible crypto personalities (e.g., “find me diamond-hand maximalists who love memes and purple NFTs”)
+4. Mini-games: predict your own Vibe Score in 7 days for bonus points/tokens, or bet with friends whose vibe will rank higher
+5. Monetization: 
+   - Premium cosmetic frames & animations (paid in OPENX or ETH)
+   - Boosted visibility in the leaderboard
+   - Allow projects to sponsor rare traits or temporary “badges” (e.g., “Attended Devcon 2025” verified badge)
+6. Fully on-chain provenance: every Vibe Card is an SVG NFT stored on Base, tradeable, and composable with other protocols
+
+Make it fun, slightly sarcastic, visually stunning, and deeply crypto-native. Include memes, references to 2021–2025 cycles, and easter eggs for OGs. The tone should feel like a mix of Dune, Farcaster, and a fortune teller who actually knows your wallet.
+
+Generate:
+- Full app name & tagline
+- Complete description for the Mini App Factory
+- Suggested UI layout (home, card reveal animation, match screen, profile)
+- Key prompts for the AI engine
+- Monetization settings
+- Suggested tokenomics/integration with $OPENX
+- Viral sharing hooks for Farcaster/X/Base
+
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
